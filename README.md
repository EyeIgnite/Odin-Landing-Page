# Odin-Landing-Page
Landing page  assignment for The Odin Project

# Finishing Notes
Just about done with this project. It was a lot tougher than I thought it'd be and I struggled heavily for a few days trying to move things around. Eventually managed to get a layout I Was happy with and style it as I wanted. Need to keep a mental note to commit often even when I'm constantly deleting and readding code; forgot to do any commits when laying out the page for 2 days which is not good. Also ran into a problem with some parts at the top of the page not being responsive. Spent a bit of time trying to fix that but couldn't figure it out so will come back at a later date and sort it. Definitely more comfortable with Flexbox but long way to go before any kind of mastery. Fun project overall, learned a lot!
